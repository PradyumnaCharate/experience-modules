# 1. User Management - Completed
# 2. Product Management and their Review and rating management - Completed
# 3. Product Search using elasticsearch - completed

I have implemented here common service which contains all commonly used crud operations. so products and reviews are extending their base class common service.
Also elastic search function has been added to common service in common folder,pagination for that is also implemented.
This function is used in product search api which is accepting query and searching through elastic search.
Mongoose middleware is adding products to mongodb as well processing that same product to elastic search index called products.
so products are getting saved their as well.so we can search in minimal time. I have completed all mentioned modules in email.
If you have any doubt kindly feel free to ask me on my email pradyumnacharate1@gmail.com.
